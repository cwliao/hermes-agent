# Hermes upstream updater runbook

## Contract

The updater uses **rebase-based review candidate + snapshot promotion**.
Review-only never deploys, restarts, or pushes. Apply never runs unless one
specific candidate is `APPROVED` and the operator supplies the matching
`HERMES_UPSTREAM_APPROVAL_TOKEN`.

The live release is immutable. A deploy must create a new release snapshot,
retain the previous release and drop-in, switch the effective systemd paths,
then verify both service health and the expected candidate SHA.

## Inspect and review

Run the read-only gate first:

```bash
python scripts/hermes_upstream_preflight.py \
  --repo "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-agent" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-upstream-state" \
  --mode review --json
```

Then create a candidate:

```bash
python scripts/hermes_upstream_review.py \
  --repo "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-agent" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-upstream-state" \
  --json
```

The JSON output and
`$HERMES_HOME/hermes-upstream-state/candidates/<run_id>.json` are the source of
truth. Record `candidate_sha`, `release_id`, `source_sha`, `parent_sha`, and
`review_branch` before approving. Inspect the diff from `source_sha` to
`candidate_sha`; do not approve a candidate by branch name alone.

## Approve and apply

Approval is explicit and candidate-specific. Store only the SHA-256 hash of
the approval token in metadata as `approval.approval_token_sha256`; never put
the raw token in logs or files. The apply command defaults to dry-run:

```bash
export HERMES_UPSTREAM_APPROVAL_TOKEN='provided-out-of-band'
python scripts/hermes_upstream_apply.py \
  --repo "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-agent" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.hermes/hermes-upstream-state" \
  --run-id <run_id> \
  --release-root "$HOME/.hermes/releases" \
  --systemd-dropin "$HOME/.config/systemd/user/hermes-gateway.service.d/<new-dropin>.conf" \
  --previous-release <known-good-release-path> \
  --previous-dropin <known-good-dropin-path>
```

Review the dry-run output, then add `--execute` only after the operator has
confirmed the exact SHA, release id, rollback paths, and service unit. The
successful output must show the immutable `release_path` and verified service
identity.

## State and recovery matrix

| State/code | Meaning | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| `READY` | Read-only gates passed | Continue only in the requested phase |
| `LOCKED` | Another updater owns the lease | Wait, or inspect owner/pid; never delete a live lock |
| `DIRTY_WORKTREE` / `NON_MAIN_BRANCH` | Source is unsafe to rebase | Inspect and repair source, then rerun preflight |
| `REBASE_CONFLICT` | Candidate could not be replayed | Resolve intentionally or retry review; no apply is allowed |
| `STALE_REVIEW_CANDIDATE` | Candidate/ref/metadata is stale or incomplete | Inspect and regenerate; do not reuse old marker |
| `PUSH_REJECTED` | Remote rejected or recorded rejection | Reconcile `origin/main`, regenerate candidate, retry explicitly |
| `MARKER_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH` | Apply marker does not match metadata/SHA | Stop and rebuild the candidate/marker |
| `FAILED` | Fetch, build, restart, or health operation failed | Preserve logs and rollback to the previous known-good release |

On conflict or preflight failure, the runner leaves no temporary review
worktree, active lock, or new review ref. On apply failure, the runner restores
the previous drop-in and restarts the known-good service; the failed snapshot
and candidate metadata remain for audit.

## Verification evidence

Use the artifact path returned by the runner and verify the effective unit:

```bash
systemctl --user show hermes-gateway.service \
  -p ActiveState -p SubState -p MainPID -p WorkingDirectory \
  -p ExecStart -p DropInPaths
```

Never infer the live version from the development checkout's `HEAD`. A restart
without a changed effective release path is not a deployment.
