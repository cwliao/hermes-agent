# HERMES-AUTH-002: parameterize public DGX target metadata

## Problem

The public repository currently contains the operational DGX SSH host and
username in the wrapper scripts and handover material. They are not secrets,
but publishing a real host/user pair creates unnecessary reconnaissance
exposure and makes the wrapper target-specific.

## Goal

Move the DGX SSH host and user to user-owned Hermes configuration outside the
repository while preserving the existing fail-closed recovery contract.

The implementation must use the existing `~/.hermes/config.yaml` behavioral
configuration path rather than adding new user-facing `HERMES_*` environment
variables. Missing or malformed target configuration must fail closed with a
machine-detectable configuration error; it must never guess a host, accept a
host key, or fall back to a different agent.

The first independent review pass on 2026-08-15 reached a `REVISE` consensus
between the authenticated DGX Claude and WSL AGY reviewers. The correction set
below is part of this ticket contract and must be re-reviewed before any
implementation, merge, or deployment gate can advance.

## Scope

- Add a documented config shape for the DGX SSH target under the existing
  Hermes config system.
- Define the canonical user-owned YAML shape as:

  ```yaml
  dgx_ssh:
    host: "<configured-hostname-or-ipv4>"
    user: "<configured-ssh-user>"
  ```

  `HERMES_HOME` remains the existing optional home selector; it is not a new
  ticket-specific environment variable. WSL resolves
  `${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/config.yaml`; native Windows resolves
  `${HERMES_HOME:-$env:USERPROFILE/.hermes}/config.yaml`. There is no fallback
  between these paths and no baked-in target.
- Add one small shared resolver (`scripts/dgx_target.py`) used by both
  wrappers. Its raw-read primitive is explicitly
  `hermes_constants.get_hermes_home()` for the canonical home path plus
  `utils.fast_safe_load()` for parsing the selected file. It must not import or
  call `load_config()` or `read_raw_config()`, because those APIs intentionally
  collapse parse/type failures into defaults/empty data. The resolver must
  distinguish missing/unreadable/malformed/non-mapping/partial target data,
  validate the two scalar values, and emit only a validated `user@host` result.
  Its process contract is: exactly one `user@host` line on stdout and exit 0
  on success; `CONFIG_ERROR:<stable-reason>` on stderr, no stdout, and exit 78
  for every config or resolver failure. If the resolver or its Python runtime
  is unavailable, the wrapper returns the same configuration error and does
  not attempt SSH.
- Pin the resolver import contract: when executed as a standalone script,
  `scripts/dgx_target.py` inserts `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` at the
  front of `sys.path`, then imports exactly
  `hermes_constants.get_hermes_home` and `utils.fast_safe_load`. It must not
  depend on the caller's current working directory or an activated virtual
  environment.
- Define interpreter discovery without adding a new user-facing environment
  variable: WSL tries `python3` then `python`; native Windows tries
  `python.exe` then `py.exe -3`. The wrapper invokes the resolver by argument
  array/call operator (never a shell-built command string), verifies its output
  is exactly one safe line, and converts any unexpected output/exit status to
  `CONFIG_ERROR`/78.
- Update both `scripts/dgx_ssh.sh` and `scripts/dgx_ssh.ps1` to resolve the
  same configured user/host and preserve identity, strict host-key, timeout,
  auth classification, and remote-exit-status behavior.
- Standardize configuration failures as stderr prefix `CONFIG_ERROR:` and
  exit status `78` (`EX_CONFIG`) on both wrappers. This includes missing,
  unreadable, malformed, non-mapping, empty, partial, or invalid target
  values. Host values are hostname/IPv4 only and user values are restricted to
  safe SSH username characters; neither may contain whitespace, `@`, `/`,
  `:`, shell metacharacters, or a leading `-`. The exact resolver bounds are:
  host length 1-253, each dot-separated label length 1-63 with only ASCII
  letters/digits/hyphens and alphanumeric label ends; user length 1-32 with
  `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`.
- Replace real host/user literals in public operational documentation with
  placeholders or configuration references where they are not required as
  historical evidence. This includes active runtime sections in
  `docs/HANDOVER.md` and `docs/ROADMAP-HERMES-DGX.md`, the recovery guide, the
  wrappers, and active tests; specifically remove the current operational
  host/user presentation in `docs/HANDOVER.md` §3. `ROADMAP-HERMES-DGX.md`
  must be searched as an audit target and changed only if an active pair is
  present; the current snapshot has no such pair. Preserve repository identity strings such as
  `github.com/cwliao/hermes-agent`; preserve completed AUTH-001 evidence only
  when it is explicitly labeled historical and non-operational. Add that
  historical/non-operational annotation inline beside the raw host/user output
  block in `docs/plans/2026-08-14-hermes-auth-001-dgx-ssh-recovery.md`.
- Add behavioral tests for configured targets, missing configuration,
  malformed configuration, non-mapping/empty/partial/invalid targets, resolver
  unavailability, and parity across WSL and native Windows paths. The native
  matrix must include a missing `python.exe`/`py.exe` resolver runtime while
  WSL is unavailable. Tests must assert no network call occurs on
  configuration failure and must replace the current source-snapshot
  assertions `readonly DGX_HOST=...` and the PowerShell/fake-SSH literals
  containing `cwliao@140.96.58.171` with behavioral assertions against a
  configured test target. At least one success test per platform must assert
  the fake-SSH log contains the exact configured `user@host` emitted by the
  resolver; every config-error test must assert the fake SSH process was never
  invoked.

## Non-goals

- Do not store passwords, MFA values, private keys, tokens, or host keys.
- Do not weaken `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`, add `sshpass`, or auto-accept
  unknown host keys.
- Do not change the DGX runtime, Telegram, systemd drop-ins, or release
  deployment as part of this ticket.

## Acceptance gates

1. Independent AGY and Claude review agree on the correction set.
2. Local behavioral tests cover valid, missing, and malformed target config on
  WSL and native Windows fallback paths without network access.
3. GitHub CI passes the wrapper Windows job and all required checks.
4. Public tracked source/scripts/docs contain no active hardcoded DGX target
  pair; historical evidence is either redacted or clearly non-operational.
5. Merge and deployment remain separate authorized gates.

## Reconciled review corrections

The independent reviewers agreed that the original plan was underspecified in
five material areas: the config schema and resolution bridge, native-Windows
parity, explicit fail-closed validation and exit semantics, behavioral test
coverage, and the active-versus-historical documentation boundary. The
resolver dependency is intentionally fail-closed: a missing Python/runtime or
resolver failure is `CONFIG_ERROR`/78, never an SSH attempt or authentication
classification. The implementation review must prove that this new failure
mode is documented and tested.

## Final plan-review evidence

On 2026-08-15, the same bounded packet and plan-only correction set were
reviewed independently by authenticated DGX Claude Haiku and authenticated
WSL AGY (`gemini-3.7-flash-low`). Both returned `PASS`; the AGY result required
one bounded retry after a timeout. This is a plan-review PASS only. The
resolver, wrapper changes, behavioral tests, CI, implementation review,
merge, and deployment have not run and remain separate gates.

## Evidence boundary

The current DGX deployment is the separately merged Calendar Guard release
`v2026.8.15-hermes-calendar-guard-1b3d444955` from main SHA
`1b3d4449553433100038f38e7b58f2f2dc489fa7`. AUTH-002 must not change that
runtime as part of the plan-only review or implementation gate; it starts from
the current merged mainline and remains a separate ticket from AUTH-001 and
Calendar Guard.
